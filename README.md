## About

#### **What Inspired Us**  
Project Truth was inspired by the pressing need for transparency and accountability in governance, aligned with the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 16. Observing the influence of biased social media narratives and the lack of actionable data for measuring governance performance, we envisioned a platform where real, unbiased issues could be raised and addressed collaboratively. A platform called _GROUND News_ shows the importance of unbiased data. Events like the GNEC Hackathon 2024 Fall motivated us to channel our efforts into creating a meaningful, impactful solution. Tools like Ground News also emphasized the importance of neutral data in shaping public opinion.

### Problem Addressed

#### Goal 16 UN SDG's

Using this project we can make an impact on every sdg's as the goals are majorly influenced by the political governance in a country.
And, acting on those issues can make an positive impact to the society and help in achieving the SDG's.

Goal 16: Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels.

Under United nations - Department of Economic and Social Affairs Sustainable Development:
Topic - [Information for integrated Decision-Making and Participation](https://sdgs.un.org/topics/information-integrated-decision-making-and-participation)

#### Problem Definition
The socio-economic-environmental challenges that we face today are mostly influenced by the working of the government / ruling party.

Issues like drainage blockage, garbage collection, landfills, pollution, no safe water, house/property issues, unemployment, poor education quality or any other surrounding environment issues, etc. comes majorly under their respective departments that run on people's money.

#### Social Media Influence

- In this, social media influence plays a major role leading to misunderstandings, false data and reports.
- Also constant display of false fame leads to misconceptions that a particular party is doing very good work even though nothing is achieved.
- Often such influence does not focus on the major underlying issues or the main issue at all, they tend to differentiate and diverge to an entirely different or non-existent issues.
- Social media baisness can be seen very clearly through television, media, entertainment, actors, etc. The youth when exposed to such false influence tends to a follow such idols.

### Solution

The very first step of problem solving is problem analysis, that most of the political parties and government appears (not sure) to be skipping.

The **Project Truth** focusses mainly on problem analysis step.

The project intends to bring real data without any biasness towards a particular political party / officers / government to all the people.

Consider this as a **public initiative** where people can:

1. Raise an issue against a political leader, department, officer or a concern/appeal via application.

2. The user may also suggest some solutions and importantance and advantages of resolving the issue.

3. The statistics of this issues collected can be displayed over map and thoroughly analysed by everyone.

4. The user can then verify if that particular issue is resolved or not.

5. The entire system works on data privacy policy the users info is not shared nor used for any other things except verification.

6. The system then shows the abstracted issues (issues which are refined with no user data involved) to everyone so as to measure the performance of a political party over a region and time.

Now the people can directly consider the statistics and get a **quantitative term to measure the performance** of the government / political party.

### Advantages

1. Truth, trust and transperency increases with the working of the government.

2. Government can also take advantage of such data and act on areas with major problems quickly.

3. More people gets involved in the working of the government. This gives people more power over problem solving in real life.

4. More people can help in resolution of a common issues.

5. Useful in measuring the performance or feseability of the government / political party.

6. More clear and concise understand of the progress / development in the country.

7. Better and more efficient solutions might come up if multiple people suggests.

8. What actions have been taken, their positive and negative effects can be monitored by the government as well as people and improved furthur.

### Current Limitations

1. Verification is dependent on the government support. [In India, the mostly used digital user identification is Aadhar UID. The verification of user through Aadhar requires permits.]

2. Data security: As a developer to display a prototype working, the user verification is done via email. No user data will be used for any purposes. Account and Data deletion is always available. To understand more see, Developers - Data Security.

3. Platform development: More tools can be added to enhance user experience and for advanced data analysis. To contribute to the project see, Developers - GitHub.

### **What We Learned**  
Building this project taught us valuable lessons:  
- **The power of unbiased data**: Transparent systems can empower communities and rebuild trust.  
- **User-centric design**: Designing intuitive tools fosters engagement and usability.  
- **Data privacy challenges**: Maintaining trust requires robust privacy and security practices.  
- **Collaboration matters**: The diversity of ideas leads to innovative solutions.

### **How We Built It**  
We developed Project Truth using the following:  
- **Frontend**: React and Tailwind CSS for an interactive and user-friendly interface.  
- **Backend**: Python Flask to handle user input, issue submissions, and data management.  
- **Database**: MongoDB for efficient storage of anonymized user data and issue tracking.  
- **Mapping & Analysis Tools**: Integrated APIs for map visualizations and dynamic data analytics.  

The system is designed to prioritize **data abstraction** and **user privacy**, with options for raising, verifying, and analyzing issues anonymously.

### **Challenges We Faced**  
1. **Data Privacy**: Ensuring secure user verification without breaching privacy was a critical challenge. We opted for email-based verification for the prototype while planning for future government partnerships.  
2. **Bias Elimination**: Creating a system that processes user inputs without political or social bias required advanced filtering and abstraction techniques.  
3. **Complex Analysis**: Integrating tools to display comprehensive, actionable insights from large datasets took time and iteration.  
4. **Scalability**: Designing a system that can adapt to a growing user base and data influx while maintaining performance.  

Despite these challenges, we built a prototype that demonstrates the platform's potential and scalability, paving the way for future enhancements.
